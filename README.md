# Bluetooth HCI parser.
A fully custom Bluetooth Host Controller Interface (HCI) packet parser.

This library and CLI tool will be part of a larger bluetooth related project I am working on. The exact dimensions of the project are not yet decided upon, but a parser will definitely be necessary. Additionally, on a personal level, this will help me understand the protocol better.
